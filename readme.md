# `did:keri` Method Spec

## Introduction
KERI provides a means for secure and decentralised key management. This specification defines a DID method based
on KERI.

The Key Event Receipt Infrastructure is a system for secure self-certifying Identifiers which aims at minimum
sufficiency and maximum security. It defines mechanisms for proving the Root of Trust for self-certifying
Identifiers and their associated Key State. This spec defines a transform from Key State to DID Document, such
that any valid Key Event Log can be processed into a DID Document.
